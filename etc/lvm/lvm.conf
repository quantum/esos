	# the device id. After reboot, or if the device is reattached,
	# the device name may change, in which case lvm will not find
	# the expected PV on the device listed in the devices file.
	# This setting controls whether lvm will search other devices,
	# outside the devices file, to look for the missing PV on a
	# renamed device. If "none", lvm will not look at other devices,
	# and the PV may appear to be missing. If "auto", lvm will look
	# at other devices, but only those that are likely to have the PV.
	# If "all", lvm will look at all devices on the system.
	# This configuration option has an automatic default value.
	# search_for_devnames = "auto"

	# Configuration option devices/filter.
	# Limit the block devices that are used by LVM commands.
	# This is a list of regular expressions used to accept or reject block
	# device path names. Each regex is delimited by a vertical bar '|'
	# (or any character) and is preceded by 'a' to accept the path, or
	# by 'r' to reject the path. The first regex in the list to match the
	# path is used, producing the 'a' or 'r' result for the device.
	# When multiple path names exist for a block device, if any path name
	# matches an 'a' pattern before an 'r' pattern, then the device is
	# accepted. If all the path names match an 'r' pattern first, then the
	# device is rejected. Unmatching path names do not affect the accept
	# or reject decision. If no path names for a device match a pattern,
	# then the device is accepted. Be careful mixing 'a' and 'r' patterns,
	# as the combination might produce unexpected results (test changes.)
	# Run vgscan after changing the filter to regenerate the cache.
	#
	# Example
	# Accept every block device:
	# filter = [ "a|.*|" ]
	# Reject the cdrom drive:
	# filter = [ "r|/dev/cdrom|" ]
	# Work with just loopback devices, e.g. for testing:

	# Accept all loop devices and ide drives except hdc:

	# Use anchors to be very specific:
	# filter = [ "a|^/dev/hda8$|", "r|.*|" ]
	#
	# This configuration option has an automatic default value.
	# filter = [ "a|.*|" ]

	# Configuration option devices/global_filter.
	# Limit the block devices that are used by LVM system components.

	# When 1, LVM will detect PVs layered on LVs, and caution must be
	# taken to avoid a host accessing a layered VG that may not belong
	# to it, e.g. from a guest image. This generally requires excluding
	# the LVs with device filters. Also, when this setting is enabled,
	# every LVM command will scan every active LV on the system (unless
	# filtered), which can cause performance problems on systems with
	# many active LVs. When this setting is 0, LVM will not detect or
	# use PVs that exist on LVs, and will not allow a PV to be created on

	# Configuration option devices/ignore_lvm_mirrors.
	# Do not scan 'mirror' LVs to avoid possible deadlocks.
	# This avoids possible deadlocks when using the 'mirror' segment type.
	# This setting determines whether LVs using the 'mirror' segment type

	# impossible to create VGs on top of mirror LVs, i.e. to stack VGs on
	# mirror LVs. If this setting is disabled, allowing mirror LVs to be
	# scanned, it may cause LVM processes and I/O to the mirror to become
	# blocked. This is due to the way that the mirror segment type handles
	# failures. In order for the hang to occur, an LVM command must be run
	# just after a failure and before the automatic LVM repair process
	# takes place, or there must be failures in multiple mirrors in the
	# same VG at the same time with write failures occurring moments before
	# a scan of the mirror's labels. The 'mirror' scanning problems do not

	# An LV with the 'mirror' segment type is composed of mirror images

	# Accepted values:
	#   remove
	#     Simply remove the faulty device and run without it. If the log
	#     device fails, the mirror would convert to using an in-memory log.
	#     This means the mirror will not remember its sync status across
	#     crashes/reboots and the entire mirror will be re-synced. If a
	#     mirror image fails, the mirror will convert to a non-mirrored
	#     device if there is only one remaining good copy.
	#   allocate
	#     Remove the faulty device and try to allocate space on a new
	#     device to be a replacement for the failed device. Using this
	#     policy for the log is fast and maintains the ability to remember
	#     sync state through crashes/reboots. Using this policy for a
	#     mirror device is slow, as it requires the mirror to resynchronize
	#     the devices, but it will preserve the mirror characteristic of
	#     the device. This policy acts like 'remove' if no suitable device
	#     and space can be allocated for the replacement.
	#   allocate_anywhere
	#     Not yet implemented. Useful to place the log device temporarily

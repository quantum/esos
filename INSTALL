The ESOS project is comprises, a Makefile that puts all of the pieces
together, scripts, config files, and a text user interface (TUI) for system
management and storage provisioning functions. The Makefile fetches all
required distribution files, and then extracts and compiles everything.
The 'image' target will build a disk image suitable for writing to a USB flash
drive; you then use this ESOS USB drive as the boot disk on your storage server.


Building ESOS:
In order to build ESOS, you need a recent release of a modern Linux
distribution that has the software development packages installed. Please
visit the ESOS project home page for all of the prerequisites and detailed
build instructions: http://www.esos-project.com/

If this source is coming from GitHub then you will need to generate the
configure script, otherwise if this is a release, it should already be present.

The following should work in most cases (adjust -jN flag to your liking):
autoconf
./configure
sudo make symlink
make -j5 -w -Orecurse > /tmp/bootstrap.out 2>&1
sudo ./chroot_build.sh -j5 -w -Orecurse > /tmp/chroot.out 2>&1
sudo rm /tools
sudo make image

If you would like to create a distribution tarball package:
make pkg_dist

You can also create a bootable ESOS ISO installer:
sudo ./esos2iso.sh isolinux

Installing ESOS to a USB flash drive:
Once you have successfully built ESOS following the directions above, or you
have downloaded/extracted a binary distribution package, run the following
script from the ESOS source/package root directory:
./install.sh

This script will walk you through writing the ESOS disk image to a USB flash
drive and adding any desired RAID controller management utilities.

Installing ESOS in a VM or onto local boot media:
Use the "esos2iso.sh" script as described above and burn your ESOS ISO to a CD,
or connect the ISO file using your server's virtual media feature. When the ISO
menu appears, choose the "ESOS ISO Installer Script" option and the ISO will
boot and prompt for the installation device.

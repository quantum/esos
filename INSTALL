The ESOS project is comprised of a Makefile that puts all of the pieces
together, scripts, config files, and a text user interface (TUI) for system
management and storage provisioning functions. The Makefile fetches all
required distribution files, and then extracts and compiles everything.
The 'image' target will build a disk image suitable for writing to a USB flash
drive; you then use this ESOS USB drive as the boot disk on your storage server.


Building ESOS:
In order to build ESOS, you need a recent release of a modern Linux
distribution that has the software development packages installed. Please
visit the ESOS project home page for all of the prerequisites and detailed
build instructions: http://www.esos-project.com/

If this source is coming from GitHub then you will need to generate the
configure script, otherwise if this is a release, it should already be present.

The following should work in most cases (adjust -jN flag to your liking):
autoconf
./configure
sudo make symlink
make -j5 -w -Orecurse > /tmp/bootstrap.out 2>&1
sudo ./chroot_build.sh -j5 -w -Orecurse > /tmp/chroot.out 2>&1
sudo rm /tools
sudo make image

If you would like to create a distribution tarball package:
make pkg_dist


Installing ESOS:
Once you have successfully built ESOS following the directions above, or you
have downloaded/extracted a binary distribution package, run the following
script from the ESOS source/package root directory:
./install.sh

This script will walk you through writing the ESOS disk image to a USB flash
drive and adding any desired RAID controller management utilities.


Help:
If you're still having trouble building/installing ESOS, even after reading the

A special thanks to the SCST (scst.sourceforge.net) project & development
team -- ESOS is built around SCST, and we really owe everything to them.

This article was very helpful in designing ESOS, specifically with the
init setup (BSD style).

Lots of information/ideas came from this document when creating the 'image'
Makefile recipe and the disk imaging process.

The Linux From Scratch (LFS) project has been very helpful with everything from
specific package build recipes, to cross-compiler setup. Their work is very
much appreciated!
